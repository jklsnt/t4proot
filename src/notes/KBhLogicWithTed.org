* Intro, and a Book!
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logicomix][Logicomix!]]

Logic and atheism as quintessentially modern.

> Reality does not need to be consistent, but our models of reality should be consistent.

* Category Theory
A specialty of mathematics that is somewhat new. Category theory aims to reshape mathematics to instead of studying the /objects/, we study the transformations.

Category theory has /objects/ and /morphism/: "things" and "ways to go between things".

** Extensions of Category Theory
Category is a generalization of proofs

- Logic => Objects represent /propersitions/, morphisms represent /proofs/
- Programs => Objects represent /datatype/, morphisms represent /programs/

| **Category Theory** | Physics | Topology  | Logic       | CS        |
|---------------------+---------+-----------+-------------+-----------+
| Object              | System  | Manifold  | Proposition | Data Type |
| Morphism            | Process | Cobordism | Proof       | Program   |

As you could see, category theory is a generalization.

** Category
Define category $C$

- Collection of objects, where if $X$ is an object of $C$, we write $X \in C$.
- For every pair $(X,Y)$, a set $hom(X,Y)$ of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$. We call this set $hom(X,Y)$ a homset. If $f \in hom(X,Y)$, then we write $f:X->Y$.

Objects and morphisms are independent, but an /morphism/ of one category could be /objects/ of another.

Such that...

- Every object $X$ has an identity morphism: $1_x: X \to X$
- Morphisms are composable: given $f: X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ there is a composite morphism $gf:X \to Z$, sometimes also written $g \circ f$
- An identity morphism is both a left and a right unit for composition: if $f: X\to Y$, then $y1_x = f = 1_yf$
- Composition operation is associative, so $(gf)a \cong g(fa)$.

**A category is a network of composable relationships.**

** Funtors
Mapping operators /between/ categories. It could act on /both/ objects and morphisms.

Define cat $C$, cat $D$, functor $F$ maps $C$ to $D$ 

- Any object $X \in C$ to an object $F(X) \in D$ (maps objs to obj images)
- Any morphism $f: X \to Y$ in $C$ to a morphism $F(f): F(X) \to F(Y)$ in $D$ (morphs to morphs on the images)
  
in such a way that...

- $F$ **Identities are preserved**: $X \in C, F(1_x) = 1_{F(x)}$
- $F$ **Preserves composition**: for pairs of morphisms $f:X\to Y, g:Y\to Z$ both in $C$ , $F(gf) = F(g)F(f)$

** Natural Transformations
Natural Transformation are operations that make a functor to another functor.

You could go two different ways around this square diagram, you get the same answer $F'(Y)$, hence the name "commutative diagrams."

$F$ and $F'$ are secretly representations of $G$ on Hilbert spaces
