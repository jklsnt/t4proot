* Definitions
** Algebraic Structures
*** Group
    A set of items and an operation that satisfy closure, identity, inverse, assocativity
*** Field
    A group and another "secondary" operation that the set is almost a group under (except the additive identity will have no multiplicative inverse).
*** Vector Space
    A field and a set of vectors that can be added together or multiplied by scalars from the field, *with the following five properties:*
    - commutativity
    - assocativity
    - additive identity
    - additive inverse
    - distributive property
*** Subspace
    A subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space. Only need to show that it:
    1. Includes the additive identity (0)
    2. Is closed under addition
    3. Is closed under scalar multiplication
    *The subspace must use the same addition and scalar multiplication of its "superspace"*
*** Sum
    A sum of (*multiple*) *subsets* is all vectors that can be written as the sum of one vector from each sub *set* (or zero).
*** Direct Sum
    If each element in a sum of (*multiple*) subspaces can be written in only one way (with one summand from each subspace).
**** Results
***** Condition for a direct sum
      *The only way to write zero as sum of one element from each summand space is all zeros iff the sum is a direct sum.*
***** Condition for a direct sum of two subspaces
      The intersection of the two subspaces is zero iff the sum is a direct sum.
*** Linear Combination
    A linear combination is the sum of some list of vectors with each one multiplied by a coefficient from $\mathbb F$
*** Linear (In)Dependence
    *A list of vectors is linearly independent if the only coefficients in a linear combination equal to zero are all zeros. (The only $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ s.t. $a_1v_1 + \cdots +a_nv_n = 0$ is $0, \ldots, 0$)*
    Equivalent: A vector is linearly dependent in a list (and that list is linearly dependent) if it can be written as a linear combination of other vectors in the list.
    Any list that is not linearly dependent is linearly independent.
*** Span
    The span of a list is all linear combinations of that list
*** Basis
    The basis of a vector space is a linearly indepnedent list of the elements in that vector space that spans the vector space (whose span is the vector space).
    A list of vetors is a basis if there is exactly one way to write every vector as a linear combination of the basis.
**** Results
***** All bases of a vector space are the same length
***** A linearly indpendent or spanning list of the right length is a basis (buy one get one free)
*** Dimension
    The dimension of a subspace is the length of it's basis. If the basis does not exist (infinitely long), then the space is infinite dimensional.
*** Elementry Matrix
    A matrix that applies exactly one valid "row operation": multiply a row, add one row to another, swap row orders.
*** Nonsingular / invertible matrix
    A non-singular matrix is a matrix that has an inverse, and whose determinant is not zero.
** Linear Transformations
*** Linearity
    A transformation is linear if it satisfies additivity (adding inside/outside same) and homogeneity (scalar multiplying inside/outside same).
*** Injective
    When the outputs being the same implies the inputs were the same. (Mapping is one to one; each element is mapped to atmost once).
*** Surjective
    When every element in the codomain is in the range (Mapping is onto the codomain; each element mapped to atleast once).
*** Linear Map
    A map from one vector space to another that is linear (satisfies additivity and homogeniety)
**** Properties
***** Linear maps from one space to another is a subspace
***** Algebraic Properties
****** Associative: $T_1 \left(T_2 T_3 \right) = \left(T_1 T_2 \right) T_3$
****** Identity: $IT = TI = T$
****** Distributive: $\left(S_1+S_2\right)T = TS_1 + TS_2$
       And the same for the other side, but you have to be careful about whether maps can be multiplied (composed).
**** Product of Linear Map
     The product $ST$ of two linear maps $T \in \mathcal L(U, V)$ and $S \in \mathcal L(V, W)$ is the linear map $S(T(u))$ for $u \in U$.
*** Image (range, column spac)
    Every vector that can be a result of a linear map.
**** Properties
***** CHANGES AFTER RREF!
***** Surjectivity is the same as the column space being the domain (input space?)
*** Kernel (null space)
    Every vector that the linear map sends to zero.
**** Properties
***** Always includes zero
***** Doesn't change after RREF
***** Injectivity is the same as the null space being zero
*** Homogenous System
    A homogenous system is a system of equations where all the right sides are zero.
    A homogenous system always has (the trivial) solution (of zeros).
*** Isomorphism
    An isomorphism is a bijective map from one vector space to another. Two vector spaces are isomorphic if there exists such a map
    There exists such a map iff the two vector spaces are the same dimension.
*** Operator
    A linear map from one vector space to itself
**** Properties
     An operator on a finite dimensional vector space is injective iff it is surjective.
* Important Things
** Linear Dependence Lemma
   *If a list is linearly dependent, then exists one element in the list can be written as a linear combination of the other elements, and the span of the remaining elements is the same as the span of the whole list (that element didn't add anything).*
** Length of a linearly independent list $\le$ length of a spanning list
** (Spanning list contains; linearly independent list extends to) a basis
** Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps
   If $T$ is a map from a *finite dimensional* vector space $V$, then $\text{range }T$ is finite dimensional and $\text{dim range }T + \text{dim null }T = \text{dim )V$
** I/O Dimension vs injectivity, surjectivity
*** A map to a larger vector space is not surjective
*** A map to a smaller vector space is not injective
** Direct Sum and Linear Independence
   A sum is direct if the bases of the summands are linearly independent.
* Questions!!
** From the template
*** What is an "identity transformation"?
    just the identity map. an operator (must go from a vector space to itself) that does nothing.
    $$T \in \mathcal L(V) : Tv = v$$
*** What is the geometric interpretation of the determinant?
    turn rows into vectors, take the size of the parrallelogram. (magnitude of top multiplied by magnitude of bottom?)
*** What is the definition of "linearity"? How do you Apply it?
    Whether a map is linear (satisfies additivity and homogeneity).
*** What is the rank nullity theorem?
    It is the Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra
*** isomorphism vs bijective maps?
    There are bijective maps that are not isomorphisms, but because in linear algebra every map maintains structure, it is automatically an isomorphism if it is bijective.
*** What is the connection between range/null space and nonsingularity?
    In order for a map/matrix to be invertible, its rows and columns must be linearly independent?
