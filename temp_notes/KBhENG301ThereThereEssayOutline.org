- AP => Thankful for spent indifference 

*** Pressures of society holds Jaquie down (No second person)
- AD => pain as a pressure manifest in the atmosphere holding Jaquie down, nonchalantly (cool, chill, invisible. Also it's freaking air)

- AN => air as something addictive, that provides temporary relief that also takes something from you

* Claim Synthesis

| Symbol  | Representation     |
|---------+--------------------|
| Alcohol | Disenfranchisement |
| Eyes    | Memory/Knowledge   |
| Body    | Heritage           |
| Home    | Tradition          |
| Water   | Freedom            |
| Air     | Restraint          |

*In Tommy Orange's novel /There There/, the author's use of third-person perspective of Jacquie's character externalizes the systems in society which strip her of both a sense of identity and capacity to critique: creating a multifaceted grappling of the forces of oppression that plagues upon Native Americans in modern society.*
