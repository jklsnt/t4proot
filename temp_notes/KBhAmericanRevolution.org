American Colonial History: 

** 1760 - French and Indian War, cont'd
[[id:DD316413-594E-4241-9071-97AC5D3AE92D][French and Indian War]] sparked a series of hissyfits against each other between Britian and Colonists.

- Proclamation Line: responses and boycotts
- Definition of "patriots"/"loyalists" changes

** 1770s - The Revolution

*** 1775: Common Sense/Plain Truth
Common Sense vs. Plain Truth published, declared against each other.

*** 1776: Independence Declared
This is a largely plagiarized document, but nevertheless declared independence.

*** 1777: Articles of Confederation
The "13 states" formed, leveraging the Articles of Confederation.

*** 1787: Constitution
The previous one sucked, so we do it better.

** The Revolution Starts (not declared war in 1775)
In this time, there are three different groups with different lenses:

- Patriots: want to declare revolution
- Apathetic: don't want to fight
- Loyalists: want to save the British

*** 1775: organized army
Created 2nd continental congresses, Washinton hired privateers (licensed pirates) to fire at enemy shipts.

*** 1775@quebec
American forced invaded Quebec, but that was terrible because they took no account of the weather and failed.

*** Winter 1775
The American Revolution Starts, but its not officially declared

- Boycotts forced Government Shutdown
- Sent the Olive Branch partition to ask for amnesty
- **Declared the colonies in rebellion**

** Propaganda about War Starts: 1776
Declare Independence: want to get French Support

*** Commons Sense
- French began supplyling gunpower

*** New Warfare
- Regional Militia: took cover and shot at smaller regions
- Used surprised attacks

*** British Defeats
- It was not certain that Revolution was successful

*** Christmas 1776
Crossing the Delaware almost causes lost war.

- Washinton and attacked the Hessian during Christmas
- Gamble paid off, crossed tho Delaware and capture their material
- Had everything that needed to survive from the Hessian

This defeat was big for propaganda purposes, **boosted morale** and raised confidence.

** Turning Point: 1777
- Defeated British in Open Warfare
- French declared public support

Battle of Saratoga

** Paris Peace Treaty, 1783
Signed peace treaty and declared full success

** Ok so now what?
- Fighting under the "Articles of Confederation": not really united
- Constitution not written until later

- British was apathetic
- Baylin's Revolution as a Response to British Parlementary Despotism:
  - The [[id:A3D37636-36D9-4D9C-AE0E-2D3CA38EC0A2][British Parliament was breaking down]], and some very liberal factions noticed and started spreading this message
  - [[id:A25D1497-32BA-4DD9-BC3F-1EB8AC4B97DC][Pamphlets and msg. systems in America]] amplified British messages
  - [[id:17F87E0E-5208-4CF2-8EA3-291E46616AEE][British Despotism Spreads to America]]
  - Which, caused [[id:57B19BAA-64E1-4BD4-8DFC-4485D4A01D1D][reactionary forces]] that further contributed to the issue and kicked off the Revolution

** Technical
- Americans was on home turf (British through ocean, random cause)
  - Had French support
  - Washinton stood strong and consistent
  - Luck!

* Synthesis
Two: when you synthesize them, how to create the best manifestation of a thesis about the American revolution. There is, of course, no better answer; but there is no best answer.

A good synthesis all have to have a foil.

- Linebaught & Rediker and Breen: bottom up
