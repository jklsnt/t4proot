* Prompt
Synthesis about the causes of the Revolution! Have a counter argument...

Was the Revolution more of a top-down or bottom-up process?

Or was this a dynamic process, and if so what propelled it?

** Claim
**Simultaneous, shared societal observations of subjugation between social classes --- when viewed as the intersection between aristocratic politics and common economics --- created the dynamic opportunity for the alignment of colonial interests that synthesizes the disregard for practicality by Bailyn and ignorance of ideology by Breen towards one of the collective increased need for independence against the British governmental systems: creating a portrayal of the revolution as a timely reactionary force that unified cross-class interests.**
